## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character attempts to trade a useless but beautiful object (like a coral fossil) for a practical necessity (like a battery) in the novel's bottlecap economy.
- Draft a 'Preparedness in the Anthropocene' pamphlet entry for a mundane object (e.g., 'The Strategic Value of a Spare Chopstick').
- Describe a day in the life of one of the Carver twins, masters of the new resource economy, from their perspective.
- Compose the smooth jazz radio host's final, increasingly unhinged broadcast as the station's power finally fails.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a low-tech 'thermal mass cooler' system using only items described in the first chapter (hope chest, foil, magazine, water). Calculate its theoretical efficiency.
- Model the 'albedo effect' project: calculate the surface area and reflective paint needed to lower the temperature of a standard porch by 2°C.
